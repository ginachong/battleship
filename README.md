#BATTLESHIP
============

A game of battleship made with React and styled components. 
Includes user authentication and a database of user's wins and losses that are displayed when the user signs in.

This game is meant for one user to play against a computer. 

TO PLAY:
1. Create an account or sign in.
2. Choose where to place your ships. 
3. Submit your board and battle the computer.

Currently working on:
  * improving user experience when placing ships (the length of each ship)
  * verifying that user's ship placement is adjacent
  * making the computer's counter attacks smart instead of random
